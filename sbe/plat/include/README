fapi2_hw_access.H is placed here to restore the return code get/putScom APIs 
while allowing PPE Plat include directory to be before the Base HWPF in the 
include path.

1. SBE PLAT  (return codes)
2, PPE PLAT  (no return codes) used by SGPE/PGPE/CME
3. Base HWPF (return codes)

This is a dual maintenance issue that should be reconsidered in the future.
