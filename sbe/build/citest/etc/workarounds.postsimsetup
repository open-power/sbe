### Example applying a patch to cec-chip files
#echo "+++ Updating something wonderful in a simics file"
#mkdir -p $sb/simu/data/cec-chip/
#cp $BACKING_BUILD/src/simu/data/cec-chip/base_cec_chip_file $sb/simu/data/cec-chip
#patch -p0 $sb/simu/data/cec-chip/base_cec_chip_file $SBEROOT/src/build/citest/etc/patches/my_patch_File

echo "  +++ Add FSIMBOX KW for actions on 50018 register"
echo "  patch -p0 $SANDBOXBASE/src/simu/data/cec-chip/pervasive.act $SBEROOT/sbe/build/citest/etc/patches/pervasive.act.patch"
patch -p0 $SANDBOXBASE/src/simu/data/cec-chip/pervasive.act $SBEROOT/sbe/build/citest/etc/patches/pervasive.act.patch

echo "  +++ Patching powermgmt.act file"
echo "  patch -p0 $SANDBOXBASE/src/simu/data/cec-chip/powermgmt.act $SBEROOT/sbe/build/citest/etc/patches/powermgmt.act.patch"
patch -p0 $SANDBOXBASE/src/simu/data/cec-chip/powermgmt.act $SBEROOT/sbe/build/citest/etc/patches/powermgmt.act.patch

# NOTE: The below patch removes mailbox settings in standalone.simics (comes
# from HB) that cause the SBE to run in plck mode. For our CI, we need the SBE
# to be in istep mode. This patch is likely never going to be removed as long as
# we need our CI to run in istep mode.
