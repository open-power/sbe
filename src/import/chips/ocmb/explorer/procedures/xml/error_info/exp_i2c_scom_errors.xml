    <description>
       First Byte data returned from the i2c register read contains
       the size of the remaining bytes returned. This should match
       the number of bytes we requested.

    <description>
       First Byte of the address passed to i2c_scom operation did not match
       what was required for IBM scom. I2c scoms associated with 64 bits of
       are assumed to be IBM scoms and must have 0x08 set in the first byte
       of the address.

    <description>
       First Byte of the address passed to i2c_scom operation had 0x08 set which
       indicates IBM scom. But the data associated with the address does not
       match IBM scom data size.
