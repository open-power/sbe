/// Compressed Scan Chain Data Structure Format
///
/// The compressed scan ring data structure must be 8-byte aligned in
/// memory. The container data structure consists of a header
/// followed by an arbitrary number of 8 byte doublewords containing the
/// compressed scan data. Images are always stored and processed in
/// big-endian byte order. The header format is common across all
/// decompression algorithms.
///
/// ATTENTION:
/// The RS4v2 CompressedScanData had a 4 byte magic value with 0x34 ("4")
/// within its third byte, which is at the same byte position as iv_version
/// now. Users of CompressedScanData which use the magic value to detect
/// a ring data structure won't be able to distingish old and new
/// CompressedScanData for iv_version being 0x34. In the very unlikely case
/// that we would have that many versions of CompressedScanData, it is
/// strongly suggested to simply skip 0x34 as version number.
///
/// Bytes - Content
///
/// 0:1   - A 16-bit "magic number" that identifies and validates the
/// compression algorithm used to compress the data ("RS").
///
/// 2     - An 8-bit version number.
///
/// 3     - An 8-bit type field distinguishing different ring types.
/// See detailed explanation elsewhere in this file.
///
/// 4:5   - The 16-bit size of the compressed scan data with
/// this header in \e bytes. This is not the exact length of actual scan data
/// in bits, but the number of bytes used by the RS4 encoding to store those
/// compressed scan bits.
///
/// 6:7   - The 16-bit ring ID uniquely identifying the ring.
///
/// 8:9   - Dynamic init, or PLL, selector value [0:63].
