/// \brief PK timer initialization
///
/// The entry points in this file might only be used during initialization of
/// the application.  In this case the code space for these routines could be
/// recovered and reused after initialization.

#include "pk.h"


/// Create (initialize) a timer.
///
/// \param timer The PkTimer to initialize.
///
/// \param callback The timer callback
///
/// \param arg Private data provided to the callback.
///
/// Once created with pk_timer_create() a timer can be scheduled with
/// pk_timer_schedule() or pk_timer_schedule_absolute(), which queues the
/// timer in the kernel time queue.  Timers can be cancelled by a call of
/// pk_timer_cancel().
///
/// Timers created with pk_timer_create() are always run as
/// bottom-half handlers with interrupt preemption enabled. Timer callbacks are
/// free to enter critical sections if required, but must
/// always exit with interrupts enabled.
///
/// Caution: PK has no way to know if an PkTimer structure provided to
/// pk_timer_create() is safe to use as a timer, and will silently modify
/// whatever memory is provided.
///
/// Return values other then PK_OK (0) are errors; see \ref pk_errors
///
/// \retval 0 Successful completion
///
/// \retval -PK_INVALID_TIMER_AT_CREATE The \a timer is a null (0) pointer.
