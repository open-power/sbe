/// \file pk_timer_core.c
/// \brief PK portable kernel timer handler
///
/// This file contains core routines that would be needed by any application
/// that requires PK timer support at runtime.
///
/// PK implements a 'tickless' kernel - all events are scheduled at absolute
/// times of the PK timebase.  This approach gives the application full
/// control over granularity of event scheduling.  Scheduling in absolute time
/// opens up the possibility of scheduling events "in the past".  PK
/// uniformly handles this case by scheduling "past" events to occur 1
/// timebase tick in the future, so that timer callbacks are always run in the
/// expected interrupt context.
///
/// PK implements the time queue as a simple unordered list of events, plus a
/// dedicated variable that holds the earliest timeout of any event in the
/// list.  This is thought to be an appropriate data structure for the
/// following reasons:
///
/// - PK applications will be small and will not schedule a large number of
/// events.  Therefore the cost of scanning the list each time an event times
/// out is balanced against the cost of maintaining the list as a sorted data
/// structure each time an event is added or removed from the event queue.
///
/// - PK applications may schedule and cancel many, many more events (safety
/// timeouts) than are ever allowed to expire. Events can be added and deleted
/// from the simple DEQUE very quickly since there is no sorting
/// overhead.
///
/// Events are added to the queue simply by placing them at the end of the
/// queue.  If the new event times out earlier than the previous earliest
/// event, the hardware timeout is rescheduled for the new event time.  Events
/// are deleted from the queue (cancelled) simply by deleting them.  Deletion
/// does not affect the hardware timeout, even if the deleted event would have
/// been the next to time out.  It is not an error for the timer handler to
/// take a timer interrupt and find no events pending.  Pending events can
/// also be rescheduled in place.
///
/// When a timeout occurs the event list is scanned from the beginning, and
/// any event that has timed out has its callback processed.
/// Since event and callback processing take
/// time, the list is potentially scanned multiple times until there are no
/// more timed-out events in the list.
///
/// Note that callbacks are not necessarily processed in time-order.  In this
/// sense the PK time queue is like a traditional tick-based time queue in
/// that events are effectively lumped into groups of events that time out
/// together.  In a tick-based kernel the 'lump' is the tick interval; here
/// the 'lump' is a variable interval that corresponds to the time it takes to
/// process the entire event list.
///
/// Timer callbacks are typically run with interrupt preemption enabled.
/// Special callbacks may run without preemption.  This is the only part of
/// the PK kernel where data structures of indeterminate size are processed.
/// During processing of the event list by the timer interrupt handler, the
/// consideration of each event always includes a window of preemptability.

// The tickless timer mechanism has timed out.  Note that due to timer
// deletions and other factors, there may not actually be a timer in the queue
// that has timed out - but it doesn't matter (other than for efficiency).
//
// This routine must not be entered reentrantly.
//
// First, time out any timers that have expired.  Timers in the queue are
// unordered, so we have to check every one.  Since passing through the
// loop takes time, we may have to make multiple passes until we know
// that there are no timers in the queue that have already timed
// out. Note that it would also work to only go through the loop once and
// let the hardware scheduler take care of looping, but that would imply
// more overhead than the current implementation.
//
// On each pass through the loop tq->next_timeout computes the minimum timeout
// of events remaining in the queue.  This is the only part of the kernel that
// searches a list of indefinite length. Kernel interrupt latency is mitigated
// by running this function as a bottom half.  As such, interrupts are only
// disabled when explicitly requested.
//
// Because interrupt preemption is enabled during processing, and preempting
// handlers may invoke time queue operations, we need to establish a pointer
// to the next entry to be examined (tq->cursor) before enabling interupts.
// It's possible that this pointer will be changed by other interrupt handlers
// that cancel the timer pointed to by tq->cursor.
//
// The main loop iterates on the PkDeque form of the time queue, casting each
// element back up to the PkTimer as it is processed.
