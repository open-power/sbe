/// \todo GCC provides a portable version of cntlzw called __builtin_clz().
/// We should make the PK priority queues portable by using this facility.
///
/// \todo I think that if more of the port-dependent types were moved here, we
/// could break the circular dependencies in some of the header inclusion and
/// simplify the way the PK/port/chip headers are included.

/// An PkIrqId is an integer in the range of valid interrupts defined by the
/// interrupt controller.

typedef uint8_t PkIrqId;

/// PK requires the port to define the type PkThreadQueue, which is a
/// priority queue (where 0 is the highest priority).  This queue must be able
/// to handle PK_THREADS + 1 priorities (the last for the idle thread). The
/// port must also define methods for clearing, insertion, deletion and min
/// (with assumed legal priorities).  The min operation returns PK_THREADS if
/// the queue is empty. (Or a queue could be initialized with the PK_THREADS
/// entry always present - PK code never tries to delete the idle thread from
/// a thread queue).
///
/// These queues are used both for the run queue and the pending queue
/// associated with every semaphore.
///
/// On PPE42 with 32 threads (implied), this is a job for a uint32_t and
/// cntlzw().
