              - By default, the tool will check in the files from a default list pre-defined for sbe 
                Refer: sbeCmvcConstants.py

              - User can selectively choose which file/files it wants to upload to CMVC from the default list

              - The tool roll backs all the checkout/checkin in case of CMVC Operation failure

              - The tool will auto complete fix record on completion of successful code check in 

              - The internal of the work flow validates the Hash of the files on the SBE repo vs files to be
                check in to be sure that the files are correctly uploaded

              - The pre-req checks CMVC bash env and CMVC access session availability and provides verbose

                as an argument

              - User can specify file as an input but -ONLY- those pre-define files selectively using option
