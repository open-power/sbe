/// \note The use of pk_timer_create_nonpreemptible() should be rare, and the

/// potential race conditions with other interrupts that may modify thread
/// state or the state of the time queue. Applications may also require this
/// facility to guarantee a consistent state in the event that other
/// interrupts may cancel the timer.
